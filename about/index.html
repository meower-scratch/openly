	<h3>What's Special?</h3>
	Special Coding Language
	For snippets of code from special coding languages (such as code that isn't text-based such as scratch) we have special editors for Scratch, Snap, or other coding languages that are not text-based, or use special characters.<br>
	<b>All Coding Made By Kids!</b><br>
	This code is 100% by kids! Therefore there is no inappropriate content at all!<br>
	<b>Non-Profit</b><br>
	It's FREE! Everyone can have fun, and share with everyone!<br>
	<b>No ads!</b><br>
	We think there shouldn't be any distractions in your experience in openly. I mean, we don't want any party-poopers right?
