		<h1>Terms</h1>
    <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to Openly! We hope you enjoy our service. There are some rules you must follow, and breaking these rules may result in moderation action being taken against your account.</p>
		<h2>Section 2: Warning Points</h2>
		<p>Once you violate the Terms of Service (hereinafter "ToS"), Warning Points will be added to your account. <br /><br /> Warning Points are given on a scale of 1-10 depending on the severity of the rule.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Extremely Minor Violation</li>
			<li>Very Minor Violation</li>
			<li>Minor Violation</li>
			<li>Slightly Moderate Violation</li>
			<li>Moderate Violation</li>
			<li>Intermediate Violation</li>
			<li>High Violation</li>              <!-- better name plz -->
			<li>Higher Violation</li>            <!-- better name plz -->
			<li>Final Warning</li>
			<li>Unacceptable Violation</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Breaking a rule that earns more than 3 Warning Points will result in a personal warning from a moderator. Getting 10 Warning Points in total on your account will result in you getting banned for a certain period of time, and getting more than 10 Warning Points will result in a permanent ban (hereinafter "termination") on your account.<br /><br />Being banned does not reset your Warning Points, so another broken rule would result in a termination.</p>
